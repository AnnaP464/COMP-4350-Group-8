# Sprint 2 Worksheet

## Regression Testing

Since our test suite is compact and runs quite quickly we run the entire test suite when we want to test existing featues.
The way to run our test suites in root, frontend or backend directories is:

```
npm run test 
```

If running in root make sure the front and backend are booted up since the acceptance tests access the database.

## Changes to the Testinging Plan

Our testing plan has remained largely the same, with a few changes:

Mainly we have less coverage on the frontend pages due to how rapidly the development has outpaced testing due to the time constaints of this sprint.

---

## What Parts We Are Not Testing

Updated system diagram
Give % of coverage with each layer

---

## Profiler

We need to run a profiler on our api to test every end point for speed and which can be sped up and why or why not.
Also a pic of the profiler output
