## Setting up the Project
Our project is built to run on Windows and Apple OS. 
To run our project you will need a few downloads
1) Node.js + npm which powers our React typescript environment [download here](https://nodejs.org)
2) PostgreSQL for the database, when setting up the database be sure to set a password you can easily recall[download here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
3) Git to run the setup script, optional if you are ok with manually running the setup commands [download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

Upon cloning the repo you just need to go into the root and run the ./setup.sh script in bash, alternatively run each command in the order it is shown to set up the api, front-end and the postgreSQL database.

To run the project you need to run the npm run dev command in the api and the front-end folders resepctively and then go to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

## Tech Stack

##### Front End 
React - Our team has previous experience with React and similar technology (Angular), and it’s ideal for building interactive UIs quickly.
##### Back End
Node.js
- Same language (TypeScript/JavaScript) on both sides reduces context switching and speeds up development. Great for I/O-heavy apps (lots of short API calls, DB reads/writes).

Express.js
- Lightweight and unopinionated, so we can ship quickly: define REST endpoints, and keep clear “routes -> logic ->  DB” structure.
##### Database
PostgreSQL 
- We anticipate rich relationships in our data (volunteers -> shifts -> events -> organizers). We get constraints (e.g., capacity limits), transactions (no race conditions), and powerful queries for search/reporting.

PostGIS 
- Native geospatial support for “near me,” distance/radius queries, and map pins that update as events are created.
##### Blockchain
Base (Ethereum L2, OP Stack) 
- supports gamification (verifiable badges/levels tied to anchored records) and trust (organizers/volunteers can confirm history hasn’t been altered).
- built in trust can be attractive to sponsors and allow rewards to be available to a larger number of people regardless of location and independent of any organization
- can keep PII in database
